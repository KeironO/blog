  <h1>404</h1>
  <h2>Well, this is awkward...</h2>
  
  <p>You've discovered a page that doesn't exist. Congratulations! You've achieved something I thought was impossible in 2024 - finding genuine scarcity on the internet.</p>
  
  <h3>What probably happened:</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
    <li>I moved things around and forgot to update links (most likely)</li>
    <li>You typed something wrong (also likely)</li>
    <li>The page was consumed by JavaScript framework churn</li>
    <li>It's hiding behind a GDPR cookie banner</li>
    <li>Welsh government efficiency finally affected my website</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>What you can do:</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
    <li><a href="/">Go back to the homepage</a> (the safe option)</li>
    <li><a href="/blog/">Browse my blog posts</a> (where I complain about things)</li>
    <li><a href="/about/">Learn about me</a> (spoiler: it's not that interesting)</li>
    <li>Blame it on Brexit and move on with your life</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><small>Error 404: The only thing more broken than this link is the state of British politics.</small></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 2em; margin-top: 2em;">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
