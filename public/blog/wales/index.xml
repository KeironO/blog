      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined the Green Party on the day of the 2024 General Election. After everything that&amp;rsquo;s happened with Labour - the betrayals, the triangulation, the complete abandonment of anything resembling economic and social justice - I thought maybe it was time to look elsewhere. The Greens, at least, seemed to offer something different: environmental urgency combined with social justice, a politics that recognised the climate crisis as the defining issue of our time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>But you don&#39;t feel like other people</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this from my shed. Not metaphorically - literally a converted shed that I rent in Aberystwyth, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been largely alone since March. Eunice moved to the Valleys after finishing her masters in Leicester - to where my family are, to where I&amp;rsquo;m from - which made sense at the time but feels increasingly unbearable now. Video calls aren&amp;rsquo;t the same. Screens can&amp;rsquo;t replicate the simple presence of another person, the way they breathe, the small movements that let you know you&amp;rsquo;re not alone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding Light in the Longest Month</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty dour person by nature. Always have been. My default setting is to expect the worst, prepare for disappointment, and find the cloud in every silver lining. January in Wales doesn&amp;rsquo;t help - grey skies, endless rain, and a landscape that looks like it&amp;rsquo;s given up on joy entirely. But this year, stuck in the depths of winter, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering whether this has to be who I am forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Day Before Everything Falls Apart</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is election day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got thousands of Labour voters who need reminding to vote, and nobody left to remind them. Our get-out-the-vote operation - the thing that saved us in 2017 - has collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our Brexit position is political suicide, and everyone knows it except the people making the decisions in Westminster. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to be all things to all people and ending up as nothing to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting it from both sides. Remainers are furious we&amp;rsquo;re not just backing Revoke like the Lib Dems. Leavers think we&amp;rsquo;re betraying democracy with our second referendum nonsense. And I can&amp;rsquo;t blame either of them because our position makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a night. What an absolutely incredible, euphoric, vindication of everything we&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at 6am on Friday morning, still buzzing from the most extraordinary election night of my lifetime. The TV is still on in the background, showing talking heads trying to process what just happened. They&amp;rsquo;re struggling because none of them saw this coming. None of them understood what we were building out here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
