Welcome to my blog! I'm Keiron, a data scientist working in healthcare and a passionate advocate for Free and Open Source Software.

Here you'll find my thoughts on technology, programming, data science, healthcare innovation, and class war social democratic perspectives on technology and society. I explore how technology can serve working people rather than just capital, the politics of software development, and the intersection of technology with social justice.

As a class war social democrat, I believe technology should be a tool for collective liberation, not just profit. Expect posts on Python, R, healthcare data, FOSS advocacy, digital rights, worker power in tech, and how we can build technological systems that serve the many, not the few.
