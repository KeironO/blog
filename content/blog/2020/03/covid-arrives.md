So COVID-19 has properly arrived in the UK and the government's response has been to tell us to wash our hands whilst doing absolutely nothing to prepare the NHS for what's coming. It's wild watching everyone just carry on as normal whilst Italy locks down entire regions and we're still debating whether it's actually serious. We're about to get absolutely hammered and nobody in charge seems to give a shit.
