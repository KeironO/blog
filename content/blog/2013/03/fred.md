{{< poem >}}
Every lecture's the same routine
She opens up the IDE screen
"Let's create an object called Fred"
Could use literally anything instead

Fred extends this, Fred extends that
Fred implements like a twat
Fred returns a String or two
Fred does everything Fred can do

Been three months of this now mind
Could she not use a different kind
Of name like Bob or Jim or Ted
But no, it's always fucking Fred

Fair play to Fred though aye
Implements everything she'll say
Never throws a NullPointerException
Unlike me after this Java session
