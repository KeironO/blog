{{< poem >}}
Cold water again
Third day now
Maintenance said Tuesday
It's Friday mun

Standing in my towel
Debating if I can face it
Or just go to lectures minging
I do Computer Science though
Nobody'll notice

Heating's broke too
Freezing in here
No hot water
Three grand a year

Put my hand under
Pull it straight back
Fuck it
Just wash my face
Wear yesterday's hoodie

Notice board says
"Day 4 - no showers"
"Management don't care"
Someone wrote "basically camping innit"

We're not camping though are we
Camping's cheaper
And you choose to go camping
I didn't choose to pay three grand
To freeze my arse off
