{{< poem >}}
Three hours left and I've not started
Library's full, I'm broken-hearted
Happy Shopper cans stacked on my desk
This revision's been grotesque

Lecture notes I never read
PowerPoints just fill with dread
Should've started back in March
Now I'm cramming like a muppet, aye

Professor said it's all online
Been saying that since term began, mind
Clicked the link, it's all in Greek
Or maybe Java, fuck knows like

Exam's at nine tomorrow morning
Brain's not working, just keep yawning
Might just write my name and leave
Get a third, mam won't believe

Everyone else looks calm and sorted
Meanwhile I'm completelyorted
Three years work comes down to this
Absolute piss take this is
