I am 32 years old. I am what's called a millennial, the collection of people who were born between 1981 and 1996, coming of age in the 2000s and 2010s. We're the last generation to remember what life was like before the internet, the ones who actually know how computers _really_ work, who learned to troubleshoot IRQ conflicts and edit config.sys files before we hit puberty. We experienced the 2008 financial crisis as we entered the workforce, and have been told we're killing every industry from diamonds[^diamonds] to _fabric softener_[^fabricsoftener]. We're supposedly obsessed with avocado toast[^avocadotoast], participation trophies[^participationtrophies], and Harry Potter references[^harrypotter]. (For the record, I don't like Harry Potter, but that's beside the point.)

What defines millennials isn't our consumer habits or our alleged sense of entitlement. It's our economic reality. We're the first generation in modern history expected to be worse off than our parents[^worseoff]. We're more educated than any previous generation[^moreeducated] but face unprecedented levels of debt, housing insecurity, and precarious employment. We watched the financial system collapse, saw the banks get bailed out, and inherited an economy designed to extract rather than provide.

And increasingly, millennials across the developed world have decided that this system—capitalism as currently configured—isn't working. In Britain, across Europe, in America, Australia and Canada. Millennial socialism is profoundly cringe. The ironic hammer-and-sickle Twitter avatars. The podcast bros earnestly explaining theory between dick and balls jokes. The unironic use of #adulting to describe basic life skills. The desperate earnestness buried under twelve layers of irony.

But here's the thing: it's also correct.

## How We Got Here

The story of millennial socialism starts in 2003, with the invasion of Iraq. We were coming of age when our governments (Britain, America, Australia) lied us into an illegal war based on fabricated evidence about weapons of mass destruction. We watched the protests, the largest in history, ignored. Journalist Ash Sarkar describes being "one of those really earnest school children who did school walkouts because of the Iraq war" at age 11[^sarkar]. For an entire generation, this was our political awakening. We watched as the rhetoric of freedom and democracy was used to justify torture, rendition, and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The invasion of Iraq didn't just undermine faith in a specific policy. It shattered the fundamental assumption that we lived in good countries run by good people who cared about truth and justice.

Then came 2008, the economic confirmation of what Iraq had taught us politically. The financial crisis was a global catastrophe. The response revealed a grotesque inequality in how our governments valued different lives. Banks got $700 billion in bailouts in America[^tarp]. Britain spent £137 billion rescuing its financial sector. The people who caused the crisis walked away with their bonuses intact. Meanwhile, an entire generation watched their parents lose their homes, their jobs evaporate, and their own futures dissolve before they'd even begun. Youth unemployment hit 22.5% in Britain[^ukyouth]. In Spain, it reached 55.7%[^spainyouth]. Greece saw its economy contract by 25% under austerity measures[^greeceausterity]. American household wealth declined by $17 trillion[^householdwealth]. The median household income didn't recover to 2007 levels until 2016, whilst corporate profits were rising again by the second half of 2009[^corporateprofits].

The numbers tell the story across the developed world: compared to previous generations at the same age, millennials are more likely to live with their parents, less likely to own homes, more than twice as likely to be unmarried, and carry significantly more debt. We experienced what economists politely call "delayed adulthood" and what the rest of us call "being completely fucked."

Then came the movements. The 2010 student protests in London against tuition fee increases brought up to 50,000 people onto the streets. The mainstream media coverage was predictable. The BBC and others focused relentlessly on violence, with headlines screaming about broken windows whilst ignoring why tens of thousands of young people were protesting[^studentprotestmedia]. The narrative was set: dismiss the grievances, focus on the disorder.

But something else was happening. Someone in a football IRC shared a stream file for Novara FM on Resonance 104.4. I was 18. I'd grown up in a household where politics meant voting Labour and hoping for the best, where "intellectuals" were people on TV you didn't trust. Here were people my age talking about capitalism, imperialism, the state, treating the anger I felt about tuition fees and Iraq and the bailouts as rational rather than deviant. They quoted Marx and Gramsci between updates from the protest lines. They didn't talk down. They didn't dismiss. They assumed you were smart enough to follow along. For the first time, I heard working class rage articulated as politics rather than pathology.

Occupy Wall Street came in 2011. For the first time in history, a protest movement was livestreamed in real time to hundreds of thousands of viewers. Tim Pool, a 25-year-old with a Samsung Galaxy S II and a solar-powered backpack, broadcast from Zuccotti Park on Ustream[^timpool]. When the police raided the encampment at 1:30am, over 100,000 people watched live[^owsviewers]. On November 17th, 737,000 unique viewers tuned in over 12 hours[^owsnovember]. Time called him "the eyes of the movement."

But it wasn't just watching. Chat rooms exploded with real-time reactions. People coordinated, shared information, asked questions that Pool answered live from the ground. This wasn't broadcast media's sanitised footage edited for the evening news. This was raw, unfiltered, happening now. People watched for weeks from their bedrooms and decided to sell their possessions and buy bus tickets to New York. A global community formed around a live stream, bound together by watching riot police charge protesters in real time whilst typing furiously to strangers across the world.

Occupy spread. The Indignados in Spain, anti-austerity protests across Europe, hundreds of encampments globally. Yes, they were chaotic. Yes, the general assemblies were insufferable. Yes, they ultimately failed to achieve concrete policy goals. But they succeeded in something arguably more important: they introduced an entire generation to the language of class politics. "We are the 99%" wasn't just a slogan. It was a reframing of politics away from culture war theatrics and toward material economics.

The early 2010s gave us something that had been absent for decades: the opportunity to learn how to protest, how to organise, how to think politically outside the narrow bounds of parliamentary theatre. An entire generation grew up after Thatcher and Reagan had declared there was no alternative to neoliberal capitalism. Trade unions had been decimated. The left had been routed. We had no institutional memory of mass politics, no passed-down knowledge of strikes and sit-ins and collective action. Iraq, the financial crisis, the student protests, Occupy. These became our political education. We learned by doing. We made mistakes. We argued in general assemblies and livestream chats and comment sections. We discovered thinkers our schools had never mentioned. We built networks that would prove crucial when electoral politics finally opened up.

## The Numbers (They're Good, Folks)

The growth was explosive across the Anglosphere and beyond. The Democratic Socialists of America went from 6,000 mostly aging leftists in 2015 to over 90,000 members by 2021. Labour Party membership in Britain surged from 190,000 in 2015 to over 550,000 during the Corbyn era—making it the largest political party in Western Europe. In Canada, the NDP saw youth membership spike. *Jacobin* magazine, founded in 2010, reached 75,000 paid subscribers and 3 million monthly web visitors globally.

The electoral numbers told the story. Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign saw 84% of young Iowa caucus-goers back him. Corbyn's Labour won 62% of under-40s in the 2017 UK election—the largest lead amongst young voters since 1992. Podemos in Spain went from zero to 69 seats in parliament in just over a year. Syriza won government in Greece. These weren't just university radicals—this was a broad generational shift toward left-wing economics.

A new generation of explicitly socialist politicians emerged. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in America, elected to Congress at 29 after working as a bartender. Momentum activists in Britain reshaping Labour. And yes, the whole thing was incredibly online—Instagram campaigns, constant Twitter discourse, YouTube video essays—but that's because millennials are incredibly online. This is how we organise, how we communicate, how we build movements.

## The Cringe Aesthetics (And Why They Matter)

Let's talk about the podcast. *Chapo Trap House* launched in 2016 and became the most successful political podcast on Patreon, with 15,000 people paying $5/month to hear Will Menaker and friends deliver socialist analysis punctuated by crude jokes and pop culture references. They called it the "dirtbag left"—a deliberate rejection of liberal civility politics in favor of blunt, vulgar, populist rhetoric.

Is it cringe? Absolutely. Does it work? The numbers suggest yes.

The same goes for *Jacobin*, with its deliberately anachronistic Soviet-era aesthetics. The magazine's editor, Bhaskar Sunkara, was born in 1989—after the fall of the Berlin Wall—and conceived the publication while studying at George Washington University. The whole project is self-consciously ironic, deploying 1920s revolutionary imagery to critique 21st-century capitalism. It's pastiche, it's ironic, and it's also providing accessible Marxist analysis to millions of readers who would never pick up *Capital*.

This is millennial socialism's greatest strength and greatest weakness: it's built on irony and extremely online culture. The Soviet imagery is a knowing wink. The podcast bros are in on the joke. But underneath the layers of irony is something deadly earnest: a generation genuinely questioning whether capitalism can deliver a livable future.

## What They Actually Want (Spoiler: It's Not the Gulag)

Here's what drives conservatives mad: millennial socialists don't actually want to recreate the Soviet Union. Poll after poll shows that when millennials say "socialism," they mean "something vaguely Scandinavian"—universal healthcare, free university tuition, affordable housing. They want the Nordic model, not the Politburo.

Sanders explicitly invokes Denmark and Sweden as his models. Corbyn's manifesto called for renationalising railways and utilities—services that many European countries never privatised in the first place. The Green New Deal combines climate action with jobs programmes—hardly revolutionary. Public support for these policies is substantial across the developed world. These aren't fringe positions; they're mainstream social democratic policies that much of the developed world already has or had before neoliberalism.

The confusion is partly deliberate. By reclaiming the S-word, millennial socialists are rejecting the Cold War framing that equates any government intervention with totalitarianism. They're saying: yes, we want to fundamentally restructure the economy, redistribute wealth, and challenge capitalist power. Call it what you want—we're calling it socialism.

## The Material Base (Or: Why They're Right)

Here's why millennial socialism isn't going away: the grievances are real and getting worse.

**Student debt and tuition**: In America, 15 million borrowers aged 25-34 owe $497 billion collectively. In England, tuition fees tripled to £9,000 in 2012, leaving graduates with average debts of £45,000. In Australia, HECS debt is ballooning. Average millennial income growth is "practically flat when you consider inflation." You're paying more for education that delivers less economic mobility.

**Housing**: Three-quarters of millennials and Gen Z see housing costs as a fundamental problem for a stable society. The collapse in young people's home ownership is stark: in Britain, homeownership amongst 25-34 year-olds fell from a peak of 59% in 2000 to just 26% by 2015-16, recovering slightly to 31% by 2022-23[^homeownership]. In Canada, house prices in Toronto and Vancouver have become divorced from local wages. In Australia, Sydney and Melbourne are similarly unaffordable. You're locked out of homeownership, paying extortionate rents, watching property become an investment vehicle for the already-wealthy.

The crisis isn't just about buying—it's about renting too. Average UK rents have increased by £80 per week over the last five years, rising 36% since 2020[^rents]. The average renter now spends 36.3% of their income on rent—well above the 'affordability threshold' of 30%[^rentburden]. Meanwhile, rental inflation has averaged 3.71% annually since 1989, consistently outpacing wage growth[^rentinflation]. You're trapped: can't afford to buy, can't afford to rent, watching housing costs consume an ever-larger share of your income whilst wages stagnate.

**Healthcare**: In America, medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy—people die rationing insulin. In Britain, the NHS is being deliberately underfunded and privatised by stealth. Waiting lists reach record lengths. Even countries with universal healthcare are seeing it eroded.

**Climate**: 86% of Gen Z think the future will be characterised by worsening climate disasters. You're being asked to make individual consumer choices to solve a problem created by corporate extraction and governmental inaction.

**The job market**: Precarious employment, gig work, the erosion of unions, wage stagnation. Zero-hours contracts in Britain. Casualisation in Australia. You're more educated than any previous generation and less economically secure.

But the data tells the real story. Despite being better educated, millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did at the same stage of life[^earnings]. The wealth gap is even more dramatic: the median net worth of millennial households (ages 20-35 in 2016) was about $12,500, compared with $20,700 for boomer households at the same age in 1983[^wealth].

**Rising inequality**: But here's where it gets truly obscene. The generational wealth gap is staggering: baby boomers hold 51.8% of total wealth in the US, whilst millennials own just 9.4%[^wealthgap]. Boomers are more than five times wealthier than millennials as a group. In the UK, the richest 10% of households hold 43% of all wealth, whilst the poorest 50% own just 9%[^ukinequality].

But the inequality isn't just between generations—it's exploding within them. The top 10% of millennials hold 69% of all millennial wealth, up from 61% for boomers at the same age[^millennialinequality]. The poorest 50% of millennials hold less than 2% of total generational wealth. You're not just poorer than your parents—you're watching wealth concentrate amongst a tiny millennial elite whilst the rest struggle with debt and precarity.

## The Failures (Because We Should Be Honest)

Millennial socialism has its problems. The 2020 Bernie campaign revealed that young voter enthusiasm doesn't automatically translate to turnout—the youth vote didn't surge as hoped. Corbyn's project in the UK ended in electoral defeat, with Labour losing seats in its traditional heartlands. Podemos in Spain has seen its support decline. Syriza in Greece capitulated to EU austerity demands. The DSA's growth has plateaued.

There's also a legitimate critique that millennial socialism is "not a militant, fully-formed Marxism-Leninism but rather a very diffuse and confused knee-jerk socialism." It's ideologically inconsistent, strategically unclear, and sometimes more aesthetic than substance.

The extremely online nature cuts both ways: it's great for building awareness but terrible for building durable organisations. Twitter discourse is not a substitute for workplace organising. Podcast subscriptions are not the same as union membership.

## In Defence of Cringe

But here's my defence: of course it's cringe. What did you expect? A generation raised on irony and internet culture, facing economic precarity unprecedented in the post-war era, using the tools and language available to them to build a political movement. Yes, it's messy. Yes, it's online. Yes, the aesthetics are sometimes ridiculous.

But what's the alternative? Accepting that housing is unaffordable, education creates lifelong debt, healthcare is being eroded, and climate catastrophe is inevitable? Trusting that the same capitalist structures that created these problems will somehow solve them?

Millennial socialism emerged because the 2008 crisis revealed that the system isn't working for most people. The protest movements gave it a language. Sanders, Corbyn, and others gave it electoral expression. The DSA, Momentum, and similar organisations gave it organisational form. And yes, Chapo and *Jacobin* and the whole online ecosystem gave it a cultural aesthetic that's frequently cringe.

But beneath the irony is something real: a generation recognising that the economic rules are rigged, that the climate is collapsing, that the future they were promised isn't coming. And instead of accepting it, they're organising, running for office, joining unions, and yes—posting through it.

Is millennial socialism perfect? No. Is it sometimes more style than substance? Absolutely. Will it achieve its aims? That remains to be seen.

But here's what I know: when majorities of young people across the developed world say they'd support socialist policies, when left-wing party membership surges across multiple countries, when support for redistributive economics crosses traditional political boundaries—something real is happening. The kids are alright, even if their aesthetics are cringe.

And honestly? After decades of neoliberal consensus, of watching inequality skyrocket whilst being told there's no alternative, a little cringe might be exactly what we need.
