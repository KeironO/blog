Look, I'll admit it upfront: millennial socialism is profoundly cringe. The ironic hammer-and-sickle Twitter avatars. The podcast bros earnestly explaining theory between dick jokes. The twenty-somethings in DSA meetings debating procedural motions like they're recreating the 1917 Petrograd Soviet. The *Jacobin* magazine covers that look like they were designed in 1920s Moscow. The whole aesthetic is irony-poisoned, terminally online, and yes—undeniably cringe.

But here's the thing: it's also correct.

## How We Got Here (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Soviet Aesthetics)

The story of millennial socialism doesn't start with Bernie Sanders, though that's when most people noticed it. It starts with the 2008 financial crisis—the defining economic moment of the millennial experience. While bankers got bailouts, an entire generation watched their parents lose their homes, their jobs evaporate, and their own futures dissolve before they'd even begun.

The numbers tell the story: compared to Boomers at the same age, millennials are more likely to live with their parents, less likely to own homes, more than twice as likely to be unmarried, and carry more than three times as much debt. We experienced what economists politely call "delayed adulthood" and what the rest of us call "being completely fucked."

Then came Occupy Wall Street in 2011. Yes, it was chaotic. Yes, the general assemblies were insufferable. Yes, it ultimately failed to achieve concrete policy goals. But it succeeded in something arguably more important: it introduced an entire generation to the language of class politics. "We are the 99%" wasn't just a slogan—it was a reframing of American politics away from culture war theatrics and toward material economics.

The movement lay dormant for a few years, incubating in dorm rooms and group chats and Reddit threads. Then Bernie Sanders announced his 2016 presidential campaign, and suddenly there was an electoral vehicle for all that latent rage.

## The Numbers (They're Good, Folks)

The growth was explosive. The Democratic Socialists of America went from a moribund organization of 6,000 mostly aging leftists in 2015 to over 90,000 members by 2021. Young Democratic Socialists of America chapters grew from 12 to 114 campus chapters. *Jacobin* magazine, founded by a history student in 2010, reached 75,000 paid subscribers and 3 million monthly web visitors.

Bernie's 2016 primary campaign revealed the depth of support: 84% of young Iowa caucus-goers backed him over Clinton. In New Hampshire it was 83%. He won more votes from young people than Trump and Clinton combined. These weren't just college radicals—69% of Latino voters under 30 supported him.

Then came the Squad. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, elected to Congress at 29 after working as a bartender, became the face of a new generation of explicitly socialist politicians. And yes, the whole thing was incredibly online—AOC coining "the Squad" on Instagram, the constant Twitter discourse, the YouTube video essays—but that's because millennials are incredibly online. This is how we organize, how we communicate, how we build movements.

## The Cringe Aesthetics (And Why They Matter)

Let's talk about the podcast. *Chapo Trap House* launched in 2016 and became the most successful political podcast on Patreon, with 15,000 people paying $5/month to hear Will Menaker and friends deliver socialist analysis punctuated by crude jokes and pop culture references. They called it the "dirtbag left"—a deliberate rejection of liberal civility politics in favor of blunt, vulgar, populist rhetoric.

Is it cringe? Absolutely. Does it work? The numbers suggest yes.

The same goes for *Jacobin*, with its deliberately anachronistic Soviet-era aesthetics. The magazine's editor, Bhaskar Sunkara, was born in 1989—after the fall of the Berlin Wall—and conceived the publication while studying at George Washington University. The whole project is self-consciously ironic, deploying 1920s revolutionary imagery to critique 21st-century capitalism. It's pastiche, it's ironic, and it's also providing accessible Marxist analysis to millions of readers who would never pick up *Capital*.

This is millennial socialism's greatest strength and greatest weakness: it's built on irony and extremely online culture. The Soviet imagery is a knowing wink. The podcast bros are in on the joke. But underneath the layers of irony is something deadly earnest: a generation genuinely questioning whether capitalism can deliver a livable future.

## What They Actually Want (Spoiler: It's Not the Gulag)

Here's what drives conservatives mad: millennial socialists don't actually want to recreate the Soviet Union. Poll after poll shows that when millennials say "socialism," they mean "something vaguely Scandinavian"—universal healthcare, free university tuition, affordable housing. They want the Nordic model, not the Politburo.

Bernie Sanders explicitly invokes Denmark and Sweden as his models. The Green New Deal combines climate action with jobs programs—hardly revolutionary. Medicare for All is supported by 70% of Americans. These aren't fringe positions; they're mainstream social democratic policies that most developed nations already have.

The confusion is partly deliberate. By reclaiming the S-word, millennial socialists are rejecting the Cold War framing that equates any government intervention with totalitarianism. They're saying: yes, we want to fundamentally restructure the economy, redistribute wealth, and challenge capitalist power. Call it what you want—we're calling it socialism.

## The Material Base (Or: Why They're Right)

Here's why millennial socialism isn't going away: the grievances are real and getting worse.

Student debt: 15 million borrowers aged 25-34 owe $497 billion collectively. Average millennial income growth is "practically flat when you consider inflation." You're paying more for education that delivers less economic mobility.

Housing: Three-quarters of millennials and Gen Z see housing costs as a fundamental problem for a stable society. You're locked out of homeownership, paying extortionate rents, watching property become an investment vehicle for the already-wealthy.

Healthcare: Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy. The wealthiest country in human history can't guarantee its citizens won't die from rationing insulin. Meanwhile, every comparable nation has figured this out.

Climate: 86% of Gen Z think the future will be characterized by worsening climate disasters. You're being asked to make individual consumer choices to solve a problem created by corporate extraction and governmental inaction.

The job market: Precarious employment, gig work, the erosion of unions, wage stagnation. You're more educated than any previous generation and less economically secure.

## The Failures (Because We Should Be Honest)

Millennial socialism has its problems. The 2020 Bernie campaign revealed that young voter enthusiasm doesn't automatically translate to turnout—the youth vote didn't surge as hoped. Corbyn's project in the UK ended in electoral defeat. The DSA's growth has plateaued. The Squad faces constant attacks from Democratic leadership.

There's also a legitimate critique that millennial socialism is "not a militant, fully-formed Marxism-Leninism but rather a very diffuse and confused knee-jerk socialism." It's ideologically inconsistent, strategically unclear, and sometimes more aesthetic than substance.

The extremely online nature cuts both ways: it's great for building awareness but terrible for building durable organizations. Twitter discourse is not a substitute for workplace organizing. Podcast subscriptions are not the same as union membership.

## In Defence of Cringe

But here's my defense: of course it's cringe. What did you expect? A generation raised on irony and internet culture, facing economic precarity unprecedented in the post-war era, using the tools and language available to them to build a political movement. Yes, it's messy. Yes, it's online. Yes, the aesthetics are sometimes ridiculous.

But what's the alternative? Accepting that housing is unaffordable, education creates lifelong debt, healthcare bankrupts families, and climate catastrophe is inevitable? Trusting that the same capitalist structures that created these problems will somehow solve them?

Millennial socialism emerged because the 2008 crisis revealed that the system isn't working for most people. Occupy gave it a language. Bernie gave it electoral expression. The DSA gave it organizational form. And yes, Chapo and *Jacobin* and the whole online ecosystem gave it a cultural aesthetic that's frequently cringe.

But beneath the irony is something real: a generation recognizing that the economic rules are rigged, that the climate is collapsing, that the future they were promised isn't coming. And instead of accepting it, they're organizing, running for office, joining unions, and yes—posting through it.

Is millennial socialism perfect? No. Is it sometimes more style than substance? Absolutely. Will it achieve its aims? That remains to be seen.

But here's what I know: when 70% of millennials say they'd support a socialist candidate, when the DSA grows from 6,000 to 90,000 members in five years, when Medicare for All polls at 70% support nationally—something real is happening. The kids are alright, even if their aesthetics are cringe.

And honestly? After decades of neoliberal consensus, of watching inequality skyrocket while being told there's no alternative, a little cringe might be exactly what we need.
