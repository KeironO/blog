I joined the Green Party on the day of the 2024 General Election. After everything that's happened with Labour - the betrayals, the triangulation, the complete abandonment of anything resembling economic and social justice - I thought maybe it was time to look elsewhere. The Greens, at least, seemed to offer something different: environmental urgency combined with social justice, a politics that recognised the climate crisis as the defining issue of our time.

I even tried setting up a Rhondda-specific group, though that effort largely failed to get off the ground. Then the leadership election was called, and Polanski announced he was running. Suddenly, Novara Media was pushing hard in his favour, and I found myself caught up in the campaign. But as I watched it unfold, I couldn't shake the uncomfortable feeling that I'd inadvertently become an entryist - that I was willing to support someone who wanted to take the Green Party and essentially turn it into Old Labour with solar panels.

That unease was enough. I left the party before the leadership vote was even held, unable to reconcile my environmental priorities with what felt like a fundamental shift away from green politics altogether.

Don't get me wrong - the mandate is clear. Polanski won by a landslide. The membership voted overwhelmingly for this shift, this approach that positions environmental policies as fundamentally working-class issues. And perhaps they're right to try something different. The left has been losing for over a decade - maybe we need a new approach, even if it feels risky.

Polanski has gone out of his way to position himself as a populist, even going so far as to attack net zero targets as unrealistic and harmful to working families[^1]. On paper, some of this makes sense: climate change hits the poorest hardest, whilst the wealthy insulate themselves from its worst effects. The theory sounds compelling, and God knows we need politicians willing to challenge the status quo.

But I can't shake my unease about how this plays out in practice. I've watched as positive green-thinking improvements - cycling infrastructure, clean air zones, renewable energy transitions - get systematically attacked as "middle-class impositions on working families." Every environmental policy becomes a zero-sum battle between the planet and the poor, as if we can't possibly design solutions that benefit both[^2].

This feels like a high-risk strategy. Yes, badly designed green policies can disproportionately impact those with the least resources. Yes, we need to be mindful of who bears the costs of environmental transition. But when you consistently frame green initiatives as attacks on ordinary people, aren't you undermining the possibility of climate action altogether? There's a fine line between challenging elitist environmentalism and playing into the narrative that fossil fuel companies want: that environmental protection is a luxury the working class can't afford[^3].

Maybe Polanski's approach will work. Maybe this populist turn will finally build the coalition we need for real environmental action. But I can't get over this unnerving feeling that it feels like a gamble with stakes too high to get wrong.

But that's a depressing thought for another day.

[^1]: In recent interviews, Polanski has described net zero targets as "middle-class obsessions that ignore the real needs of working families" and argued that environmental policies must be "grounded in economic reality rather than idealistic timelines."

[^2]: The false choice between environmental protection and working-class interests ignores successful examples like the retrofitting programmes in social housing or community energy projects that reduce fuel poverty whilst cutting emissions.

[^3]: This framing inadvertently echoes the arguments made by climate change deniers and fossil fuel lobbyists, who have long portrayed environmental action as elitist and economically damaging to working communities.
