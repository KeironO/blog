{{< poem >}}
Tories cut our EMA
Thirty quid a week away
Half the class just disappeared
Can't afford the bus, as I feared

Used to be twenty in our year
Now it's ten who can appear
Half are stacking shelves at Asda
Rest are gone, working harder

Cameron says we waste his money
From his mansion, isn't that funny
Went to Eton, silver spoon fed
While we're choosing work over being fed

Walking two hours every day
Stomach growling all the way
Rich cunts took our thirty quid
Killed our futures, that's what they did

They're not thick, they're just poor
Can't afford college anymore
Tories hate us working class
Always have, can kiss my arse

Ten of us are left behind
Trying to learn with fucked up minds
Thirty pounds kept us in school
But helping the poor ain't Tory rule
