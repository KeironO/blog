{{< poem >}}
Mam helped me carry boxes in
Ground floor, room 14
She didn't say much
Just kept looking round

My room's smaller than I thought
Single bed, desk, wardrobe
Window looks out at the car park
Could've been worse I suppose

We went to Tesco before
Got pasta and beans and bread
She kept adding things to the trolley
"Just in case"

Back in the room she made the bed for me
Even though I said I'd do it
Brought cleaning stuff from home
Fairy liquid, toilet roll, the lot

She cried a bit
Tried to hide it but I saw
Said she was just being daft
Gave me a hug that lasted ages

When she left I sat on the bed
Rosser C, room 14
Could hear someone's music through the wall
Different now innit

Unpacked my stuff slowly
Put posters up wonky
Looked at my phone
Three missed calls from mam already
