{{< poem >}}
Half two on a Tuesday afternoon
Drunk in my room like a buffoon
Skipped databases for cheap booze
Four cans from CK's, can't lose

Trying to fix NFS while pissed
Every mount point that I've missed
Sun's still out, that's what's mad
Daylight drinking, feeling glad

Started at eleven, "just one can"
Now I'm bladdered with no plan
Still can't get the bastard working
But the lager's got me smirking

Rhodri knocked and brought more beer
Now we're fixing fuck all here
Mam would absolutely lose it
Three grand a year to sit and booze it
