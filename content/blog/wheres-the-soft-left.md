The first time I heard the phrase “class war social democrat” was at a Pontypridd Labour Party CLP meeting. It was used disparagingly, aimed at a new member, as if openly talking about class struggle were somehow improper. I didn’t take offence, but the phrase stuck with me.

The second time I came across it was when Michael Walker described himself as a “class war social democrat.” I think it may have been on Novara Live - though I’m not entirely sure - and he later wrote about it in the New Statesman. The uncertainty feels appropriate: the term has always hovered between insult, identity, and declaration.

So what does it mean? A class war social democrat starts from the simple but fundamental reality that society is divided between those who own capital and those who sell their labour. Politics that ignores that divide is polite theatre, not transformation. It’s about redistribution, public ownership where needed, strong unions, and linking social and environmental policy to real material outcomes. It’s about struggle, not just goodwill.

The Soft Left, by contrast, feels increasingly obsolete. Once, there were people willing to push leadership, argue for fairness, and achieve modest gains for working people. Today, the label often feels like a brand rather than a strategy. Many who identify as Soft Left shy away from confrontation, signalling moderation while leaving structural inequality largely intact. Even well-intentioned leaders like Ed Miliband were constrained by fiscal rules and leadership priorities, and the party continues to drift rightward when nobody pushes back.

I want to love the Soft Left. I admire the idea of principled, careful politics. But too often it stops short - unwilling to take the risks required to reduce the gap between labour and capital, or to defend social justice in the face of party orthodoxy. A class war social democrat doesn’t wait. They name the fight, define the strategy, and refuse to hide behind moderation.

The Soft Left once mattered. Today, it feels like a memory.
