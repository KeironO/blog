I've never been a fan of Goodreads. The Amazon ownership, the clunky interface, the way it gamifies reading with arbitrary ratings and social pressure. Reading shouldn't be a performance metric or a social media feed. It should be personal, reflective, and focused on the ideas rather than the optics.

So instead of feeding another corporate platform with my reading data, I'm tracking my books here. No star ratings, no forced reviews, just a simple record of what I've been reading since September 2025. Some books might get longer thoughts if they're particularly important or challenging, but mostly this is just a quiet space to acknowledge the books that have destroy my thinking.

## 2025

- **The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation** by Cory Doctorow <sup>(October 2025)</sup>

- **To Make the People Smile Again : A Memoir of the Spanish Civil War** by George Wheeler <sup>(September 2025)</sup>

- **Minority Rule** by Ash Sarkar <sup>(September 2025)</sup>
  The media cycle around the book didn't do it justice. An nabashedly Marxist analysis about identity politics, and how the right have co-opted it.

- **[The Enemy Within: The Rise and Fall of the British Communist Party](https://wellredbooks.co.uk/product/enemy-within-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-british-communist-party/)** by Francis Beckett <sup>(September 2025)</sup>
