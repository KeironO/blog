I've never been a fan of Goodreads. The Amazon ownership, the clunky interface, the way it gamifies reading with arbitrary ratings and social pressure. Reading shouldn't be a performance metric or a social media feed. It should be personal, reflective, and focused on the ideas rather than the optics.

So instead of feeding another corporate platform with my reading data, I'm tracking my books here. No star ratings, no forced reviews, just a simple record of what I've been reading since September 2025. Some books might get longer thoughts if they're particularly important or challenging, but mostly this is just a quiet space to acknowledge the books that have destroy my thinking.

## 2025

- **Minority Rule** by Ash Sarkar <sup>(September 2025)</sup>  
  The media cycle she did for the book didn't do a great service to the book. Very good, unabashedly Marxist. Good insight into the downfall of New Left without being too naval gazing.

- **[The Enemy Within: The Rise and Fall of the British Communist Party](https://wellredbooks.co.uk/product/enemy-within-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-british-communist-party/)** by Francis Beckett <sup>(September 2025)</sup>
