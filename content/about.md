Hi, I'm Keiron! I'm a data scientist working in healthcare at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Healthboard and a passionate advocate for Free and Open Source Software.

As a class war social democrat, I believe technology should serve working people, not just capital. I'm passionate about how we can use data science, programming, and open source tools to build a more equitable society. My work sits at the intersection of healthcare technology, social justice, and collective liberation.

On this blog, I explore class-conscious perspectives on technology - from the politics of software development to how healthcare data can serve public good rather than private profit. I write about Python, R, healthcare innovation, FOSS advocacy, digital rights, worker power in tech, and the broader question of how we build technological systems that serve the many, not the few.

I'm particularly interested in how technology can be a tool for collective organizing, how we can democratize access to healthcare insights, and what it means to practice data science with socialist values. Sometimes I also share thoughts on Welsh politics, the NHS, and the ongoing struggle for digital commons.
