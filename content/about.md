Hi, I'm Keiron. I'm a data scientist working in healthcare at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board in Wales. I'm passionate about Free and Open Source Software and have strong opinions about technology serving people rather than profit.

I write about technology, politics, healthcare, and the intersection of digital rights and social democracy. You'll find skeptical takes on tech hype, thoughts on health informatics, and occasional rants about Python packaging and Welsh politics.

## Connect with me

If you want to tell me I'm wrong about something, share FOSS recommendations, or just need someone to complain to, you can find me on:

- **Professional networking**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keirono/) (where I occasionally remember to update my job title)
- **Social media**: [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@redpenguin) (@RedPenguin) - for when I need to shout into the void
- **Code repositories**: [GitHub](https://github.com/KeironO) (@KeironO) | [Personal Git](https://git.keiron.xyz) (keo7) - mostly half-finished projects and commit messages written at 2am
- **Photography**: [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/163253992@N05/) - proof that Wales is prettier than my code

Feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss technology, complain about software, or just need someone who understands why your Python environment is broken again.
